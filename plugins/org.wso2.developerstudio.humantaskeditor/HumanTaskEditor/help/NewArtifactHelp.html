        This wizard creates a human task project. This project contains human task file, htconfig file and relevant wsdl files inside the humantaskcontent folder. You should enter project name, humantask file name, initial task name and target namespace in order to initialize a basic humantask project. The initial project will contain a human task file in the name you specified and 2 wsdl files for request and callback and the htconfig file specifying the wsdl files. Inside the human task file you will find a single task with the name you specified here. You can add more tasks later through the editor.
